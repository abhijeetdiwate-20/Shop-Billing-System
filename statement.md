# Project Statement – Shop Management System

## Problem Definition
Small shops often do not use digital billing systems because they are expensive or complicated.  
Due to this, shopkeepers usually calculate totals manually, which increases the chance of errors.  
To help solve this basic problem, this project introduces a simple Python-based billing program that can compute totals automatically and save the bill for future use.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is:
- To provide a simple and easy tool for generating bills  
- To reduce manual calculation mistakes  
- To practice Python programming concepts like loops, functions and file handling  

## Scope

# Included Features
 Input of item names, quantities and prices  
 Calculation of item total and grand total    
 Automatic creation and saving of bill files inside a folder  
 Timestamp-based naming for each bill  

# Excluded Features
 No database support  
 No tax or GST calculation  
 No editing or deleting items after entry  
 No GUI or web interface  

# Target Audience
This project is mainly designed for:
 Students learning the basics of Python  
 Small shop owners who want a very simple billing tool  
 Beginners who want to understand input validation and file operations  

# High-Level Functions
 A function to safely take integer input  
 A function to safely take floating-point input  
 Bill generation using loops  
 Saving bill data into a text file using Python file handling  

# Summary
This project is a basic, beginner-friendly billing system that helps in quickly preparing bills and storing them safely.  
Although the system is simple, it demonstrates essential programming skills and solves a small real-world problem effectively.
